# 3D Sphere Animation

This project generates a 3D animated visualization of concentric circles within a 3D sphere using Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Description

The script creates an animation of 2D circles layered along the z-axis within a 3D sphere. The circles rotate, giving the illusion of a 3D object in motion. This visualization can be useful for educational purposes, demonstrating mathematical concepts, or simply as an interesting graphical display.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
